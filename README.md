## Visualization dashboard website for weather data 

This is related to a previous assignment.  individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them have been created. These pages contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations (only the Landing page have meaningful explanation). We'll also have a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.
